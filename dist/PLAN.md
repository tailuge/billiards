- [x] Identify the controller state that signifies the end of a game.
- [x] In the relevant controller state (e.g., `EndState`), check if the game is a single-player game.
- [x] If it is a single-player game, gather the game result information.
- [x] Check for a player name in the game session or settings.
- [x] If no player name is found, default the player name to "Anon".
- [x] Use the `ScoreReporter` to send the `MatchResult` to the server.
- [ ] **Add a test case to `test/controller/controller.spec.ts`**
  - [ ] Create a new test case: "sends single-player match result on game end".
  - [ ] Inside the test, configure the `container` for a single-player game (`isSinglePlayer = true`).
  - [ ] Set a player ID on the container (e.g., `container.id = 'Player1'`).
  - [ ] Set a score on the rules object (`container.rules.score = 50`).
  - [ ] Create a mock `ScoreReporter` with a mocked `submitMatchResult` function.
  - [ ] Assign the mock reporter to `container.scoreReporter`.
  - [ ] Transition the container to the `End` state.
  - [ ] **Assert** that `submitMatchResult` was called with the correct `MatchResult` object:
    - `winner` should be 'Player1'.
    - `winnerScore` should be 50.
    - `playerCount` should be 1.
    - `loser` should be `undefined`.
- [ ] **Add a test case for anonymous single-player games**
  - [ ] Create another test case similar to the one above.
  - [ ] Set the player ID on the container to an empty string (`container.id = ''`).
  - [ ] **Assert** that `submitMatchResult` was called and the `winner` field in the `MatchResult` is "Anon".
